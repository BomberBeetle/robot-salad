            <p>This is my personal website, where i'm going to put all sortsa things! Mostly just showing off my work, but also fun experiments, gags and more. There's also a blog section if you want to keep up to date with the latest hijinks I've been up to.</p>
            <h3>cool, but who wrote this, exactly?</h3>
            <p>Oh, <b>I'm so glad you asked.</b> I'm <b>André Luiz</b>, also known on the internet by the pseudonyms <b>BomberBeetle</b> (on <a href="https://github.com/BomberBeetle">GitHub</a>) and <b>xdre</b> (pretty much everywhere else). I come from São Paulo, Brazil, known as the land of the drizzle (and also the economic centre of Brazil).</p>

                <p><small>Whoa mama, who's this handsome devil?</small></p>
            </div>
            <p>In terms of education, I'm fresh outta high school right now, with an additional diploma as a Computing Technician at ETESP. I've dabbled in a somewhat wide range of technologies, like node.js, .NET Core, general C#, Android Studio (with Java), Arduino, HTML/CSS and more. If you want to see my work, you can go to my <a href="#portfolio">portfolio right here.</a></p>
            <h3>This is getting pretty boring. Can I play  with something?</h3>
            <p>yeah, sure. here's a clicky switch</p>
            <ClickySwitch toggled={true}/>
            <p>In fact, you can have two more:</p>
            <div className="switchHell">
              <ClickySwitch toggled={true}/> 
              <ClickySwitch toggled={false}/>
            </div>
            <p>Have fun.</p>
            {
            //TODO: Write a personal paragraph.
            }
            <h3>Thanks! What now?</h3>
            <p>Well, there's still plenty to do here! As I mentioned earlier, you could go to <a href="#portfolio">my portfolio</a> to see some of my machinations, or you could visit the <a href="#blog">blog section</a> to read some of my ramblings. Also, if you want to have a chat, <a href="#contact">here</a> are some places you can hit me up!</p>
